# Dinobots

Graph Data structures and helper utils

## PolarGraph

GraphFrames-like structure but with Polars DataFrame and none of the convenience functions. 
It can generate a networkX graph and GraphFrame (within a spark session).

## Molecules

Convert SMILES to PolarGraphs. You can use NetworkX to perform maximum common subgraph searches from PolarGraph generated nx.Graph objects.
You can also readily convert subgraphs back to SMILES.

## BEAR

(in progress)
